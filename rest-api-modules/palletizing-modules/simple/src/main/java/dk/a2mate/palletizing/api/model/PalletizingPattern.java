 * How Do You Stack Mixed Pallet Boxes?
Depending on your operation, you may have to build a pallet differently each time with diverse box shapes and weights. While it may not be the most fun game of Tetris, there are tips to make stacking a pallet with mixed boxes easier:

Start with the larger, heavier boxes. Having larger boxes on the bottom creates a solid foundation and resists leaning.
If the smaller boxes are a lot heavier than the larger boxes, place the smaller, heavier boxes as the first layer, then place the larger, lighter boxes on top. This will ensure that the heavier boxes are not crushing the lighter boxes, causing the stack to lean.
Try to keep the same size boxes side by side.
Organize each layer so it reaches the ends of the previous layersâ€™ boxes.
Keep the square or rectangular shape of the pallet and avoid making a pyramid. The shape is what gives structure to the pallet.
